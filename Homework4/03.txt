Abstract¡X Fire incidents damaged both the economy and human life. In the past three decades, 59,387 fire incidents in Thailand approximately lost 40 billion baht and 2,076 deaths. Fire safety training methods are organized in a very limited number each year for many reasons such as training place or safety concern. We propose game-based learning for fire safety trainingusingvirtualrealitytechnology.Wecreatefivelearning lessons based on fire training contents and three playing stages (play, learn and test) that players can interact with. It behaves as a self-learning tool that can be used often and overcome the difficulty in organizing fire safety training. In addition, virtual technology simulates realistic computer graphic contents and richinteractive actions. Most importantly it offers asafe virtual environment; it extends the audience to a wide range of ages. Our game-basedtrainingis evaluated, andthe result shows that fire safety knowledge is increased by 122% and 63% compared to the non-training and the traditional training respectively as well as users' satisfaction average score is exceeded90%.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Fireincidentreferstodangerarisingfromafirethatlacks supervision; covering broadly definition including small, large fire, or conflagration. According to the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, Ministry of Interior, Thailand, there were 59,387 fire situations in the past 3 decades (1989 ¡V 2018) that approximately damaged the economy 40 billion baht, more importantly, 2,076 died and 5,413 injured [1], see Fig. 1. Both government and private agencies promote fire safety awareness and how-to-survive from the situation periodically to minimize the damage. The traditional training method involves workshop-based using mixed media such as an article or video-based content. It usually covers a definition of classes of fires, types of extinguishers and their operating procedures, fire situation demonstration,andfirstaid.Workshopsareorganizedonlya fewtimesayear,whichleadstoalargenumberofaudiences in each training, eventually, insufficient knowledge and difficultytoevaluatethetrainingoutcomes. 
The Covid-19 pandemic complicates in organizing workshops. In this research, we propose an alternative fire safety training system using a game-based learning (GBL) strategy in a virtual environment or virtual reality (VR). Playerslearnthecontentwhileenjoyingthegameplayandthe immersiveviewsuitsthenatureofcontentsbyproviding360 degrees configurable environment and rich interactivity. A system offers a completed aspect of fire safety workshop: tutorial,training,andvirtuallypracticing.

II. BACKGROUNDANDRELATEDWORKS 
A. Game Base Learning 
Game-based learning is generally a genre of game that defines alearning outcome [2]. Lessons are blendedinto the gameallowplayerstolearnbyplayingandpracticingontheir own; have fun while learning. GBL attracts players by

simulating situations, challenging and encouraging them to formself-taughtlearning.Inaddition,itmotivatestheplayers to overcome difficult tasks; splitting the subject into several smallpiecesanddeliveringintheformofgameplayeasesthe learningcurve.However,designingagoodGBLisnotaneasy task. GBL designers need to design the game structure carefullybyconsideringandvalidatingthecontentstomatch itslearningoutcomesaswellasentertaining. 
GBLcontinuouslygainspopularity, oneofitsreasonsis technological advancement, therefore, the game becomes more interesting in terms of visualization and interaction. It benefits players learning ability (if carefully designed) and influences four positive impacts: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social (multiplayer) [3]. Plass et al. [2] have reasonedtheelementsofwhythegameisaneffectivelearning environment as follows: motivation, player engagement, adaptation,andgracefulfailure,detailsasfollows. 
Motivation is an empirical characteristic ofgames as the entertainment media. Its rewards are represented in many formssuchaspoints,stars,trophies,orlevels.Theseattributes areoftenusedforlearningmotivation. 
Player engagement is used interchangeably with an activitythatplayerscommunicatewiththegame.Thedigital game provides many ways that help players with the most abilitytointeractwithandinvitethemtoengage. 
Adaptationisthecapabilityofthegamethatengageseach playerinawaythatreflectshisorherspecificcircumstance. Game measures all the variables, e.g., prior knowledge, and, therefore,offertheappropriateresponsetotheplayers. 
Gracefulfailureisoftenrequired,orevennecessary,inthe learningprocess.Thecapacityto failgracefullyisassociated with previous elements, such as motivation, player engagement, and adaptation.It challengesplayers to trynew thingsandexploringtowardsthegameobjectives. 
B. Virtual Reality Technology 
Virtualrealityisatechnologythatsimulatesareal-world environment with 3D computer graphics. It allows users to interactbyusingasetofwearabledevicesthatconsistofinput (e.g.,handstrackingdevices),processing(e.g.,computer),and displayunits(headmountdisplay:HMD). 
VR technology is utilized in many applications, its popularityforentertainmentandeducation/training purposes. Not only an immersive graphicalbut also the safety training environment. 
C. Motion Sickness in Virtual Reality 
DespitethecompellingexperiencefromwearinganHMD device, one of the most common side-effects is a motion sickness symptom; this typically refers to dizziness, vomiting, andnauseatedfeeling.Recentworkshaveexposed multiplefactorsthatcausethissymptomsuchasgender,VR environmentgenre(shittingfrompleasanttohorror),posture, orgraphicalproperties[4]. 
Moving in a virtual environment has two general types: steeringlocomotionandteleporting.Steeringlocomotionisa type of movement where users continuously initiate their moving towards the destination using the input controllers [5]. On the other hand, teleportingis where users determine the destination and are intermediately translated to that locationbypressingabutton[6]. 
Based on human sensory conflict theories, one motion sickness severity is predicted to be lower with teleporting technique [7]. Therefore, in this work, we implement a teleporting technique that translates user position to each destination; users¡¦ posture is a sit position while playing. Notethatoneofaquestioninanexperiencedassessment(see section IV.) of our workis whether or not user experiences motionsicknesswhileplaying. 
D. Traditional and Virtual Reality in Fire Safety Training 
Traditionalfiresafetytrainingusesoneofthesemethods: articlesandvideo-basedcontent,ordemonstrationworkshops. Thesemethodsareconsideredasapassiveprocedure;trainees read,listen,orwatchthecontentsandself-learningwithoutor hardly provide interactive activities. One common factor is thatitlacksinstantknowledgeassessmentandfeedback;there aremanyreasonssuchasone-waycommunication(incaseof article or video-based), a large number of trainees in the workshop,orsafetyconcern.Eventually,effectiveevaluation isdifficulttoperform. 
In contrast to traditional methods, one of the most importantfeaturesoftraininginvirtualrealityisitssafetyand rich interactive environment [8], [9]. It allows teaching a dangerous subject with more realism and safe while gaining knowledge with less effort compared to the traditional teachingprocess[10]andcost-effectivesolution[11]. 
Fire safety training is fit into a training category that suitabletoexploitfiresafetytraininginavirtualenvironment. Themostvulnerablehabitatduringafireincidentischildren [8], therefore, using safety space training expands the ageof the audience from child to adult to be attended. In addition, virtual reality training increases the effective result of the trainee and maintained self-efficacy even 3-4 weeks after completedthetraining[12]. 
BenefitingVRtrainingforhumanbehavior,includingfire safety,hasbeenreportedinnumerousdisasterandemergency situations[13]¡V[15].Recently, Saghafian etal.introduce fire extinguishertraininginvirtualreality[16].Inthiswork,aVR tracking device is installed with a real extinguisher so that player can realistically feel the device while observing its result in VR view. Training focuses on fire extinguisher operating procedures to put out the fire. Lovreglio et al. proposeacomparisonoftheeffectivenessbetweentraditional and virtual reality training environments [12]. Similarly, it focusesonoperatingfireextinguisheroperatingprocedures. 
Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there is no system that covers all aspects: educating knowledge of fire, extinguishers, and their operating procedures as well as the emergency contact numbers and first aid. We propose a systemthatcombinesallpiecestogether;itallowstraineesto geteducateandpracticealltrainingaspects.Thecomparison training features of our system with the traditional and availableproduct [17]inthemarketisdisplayedinTableI. It is obvious that our training offers two systems combined exceptpracticingwitharealextinguisher. 
III. METHODOLOGY 
In this section, we describe the methodology and technology that are used to develop the system. There are 3 mainparts:contents,gameplayandsystemdevelopment.

B. Game Design and Game Based Learning 
Gameplay is designed based on the last sub-section contents. There are 3 main stages: learning, play, and test (LPT),thesestagesarepresentedtoplayerssequentially. 
Learningstagecomprisesof4tutorials:the1st combinesa lesson 1 and 2 which is used together, the 2nd explains the detailoflesson3whilethe3rd and4th providelessons4and5 respectively.Alltutorialsarevideo-basedcontent. 
Play stage is a simulated situation that allows players to practice the content interactively. There are 2 situations: the 1st simulates the knowledge trained from tutorials 1 and 2 whilethe2ndsimulatesthetutorial3and4.Theplaysequences are controlledby agame system; the 1st playis presented to playersoncetheycompletethefirst2tutorialswhilethe2nd is presentedafterplayerscompletethelast2tutorials. 
Test stage is afire safetyknowledge assessment, we use the pre/post-test questionnaire method to ask player before and after playing a game. There are two sets of questions: knowledge-basedanduserexperiencebased. 
GBLframework explicitlydefines the learning objective of each tutorial. Thus, the 4 tutorial objectives are understanding classes of fire and types of extinguishers, knowing how to contact the fire safety agencies, ability to operateextinguishers,andunderstandinghowtodoafirst-aid procedurerespectively.

For an immersive visualization, we implement the high polygon assets while maintaining the high framerate. Two important animation assets in our game are fire and extinguisher which are usedinteractively when players learn howtousetheextinguisherprocedure. 

(a) IV. EXPERIMENTANDRESULT 

A. Experiment 
We design the experiment on volunteers who have not trained in fire safety. There are 11 volunteers (who never attendanofficialfiretrainingcourse)ofanaverageof21years of age; the gender is equally balanced between male and female. Volunteers are split into two groups for evaluating purposes: our game-based training and traditional training method. The number of volunteers in each group is 6 and5 personsrespectively.Notethat,therearemanyfactorssuchas genderorculturaldifferencesthatprobablyaffectthelearning outcome when adopting GBL as a learning medium. The studiesin[18],[19]showthatmalesandfemalesperformthe comparable result, however, males tend to slightly better handle new learning tools or anxiety than females.
